## Force Display Fix Guide
- unzip force-display.zip
- Start by running the .rb script. example: ruby .rb
- It only generates a couple of files in your user’s directory and does not require any special rights to read the current monitor / tv configuration. (TV must be connected).
- Boot to into the recovery system (Cmd+R during boot).
- All your files are accessible here and you have write permissions to the “Overrides” folder. Your system disk is just not mounted to / but to /Volumes/ (e.g. “/Volumes/Macintosh HD/”)
- Open a terminal and copy the DisplayVendor-directory. Remember that every path is now prefixed by “/Volumes/Macintosh HD/”.
- E.g. I had the Ruby script in a folder “EDID-Fix” on my desktop.
-bash-3.2# cp -r /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/Users/marcus/Desktop/EDID-Fix/DisplayVendorID-* /Volumes/Macintosh\ HD/System/Library/Displays/Contents/Resources/Overrides/
- Reboot to your system
